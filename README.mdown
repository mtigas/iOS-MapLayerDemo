# iOS Custom Map Layer Example #

**A barebones demo app that demonstrates the use of some new [MapKit][mkdoc] functionality
in iOS 4.0.**:

The *[MKOverlay][mkoverlay]* protocol and *[MKOverlayView][mkoverlayview]* class and how
to use these to render custom tile layers [a la Google Maps API][imagemaptype]. (i.e. Google
Maps-compatible tile layers from [Mapnik](http://mapnik.org/)/Tilecache, gheat, etc. See below for a django-gheat example.)

## What? ##

I refactored [django-gheat](http://github.com/mtigas/django-gheat) as a side project a few
weeks ago. I’ve been working on iOS development a bit lately and was seeking a slick way to
plug the **[django-gheat demo][gheat_demo] tileserver** into the iPhone. The Google Maps API
just doesn’t have enough performance in the browser to make for a decent user experience.

Some conversation threads recommended combining a UIScrollView with [CATiledLayer][catiledlayer],
but this seemed unwieldy to couple with the existing MapKit framework.

Lo and behold, iOS 4.0 added custom overlay functionality to MapKit, though I have not seen *any*
mention or example of it’s use to date.

## Notes ##

The code is generally commented thoroughly. I am not an expert in cartography, so
my knowledge of map projections and some of the calculations within the code are to be taken
with a grain of salt.

`CustomOverlayView` compensates for `[[UIScreen mainScreen] scale]`, or the iPhone 4’s pixel doubling.
The view applies the screen scale factor, creating a situation as if the screen were twice as large.
Because MapKit loads pixel-doubled tiles but maintains the same viewport, `CustomOverlayView` renders tiles
of the *next* (or scale-appropriate) zoom level to maintain a one-to-one mapping with MapKit’s own tiles.

The `[MKOverlayView -canDrawMapRect…]` and `[MKOverlayView -drawMapRect…]` methods rely on asynchronously
downloading tiles as requested (by `-canDrawMapRect`) into cache, and then using that cache in the
`-drawMapRect` method after the success callback notifies MapKit to try the tile again. 

I am using the Three20Network sub-library from [Facebook’s Three20](http://github.com/facebook/three20) and using
the [TTURLRequest](http://github.com/facebook/three20/blob/master/src/Three20Network/Headers/TTURLRequest.h)/
[TTURLCache](http://github.com/facebook/three20/blob/master/src/Three20Network/Headers/TTURLCache.h) stack
to handle cache storage to disk/memory. The necessary sub-libraries are bundled in this repository.
